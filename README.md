# HR-analytics-Dashboard
Developed an HR analytics dashboard to analyse employee attrition and job 
satisfaction across departments, demographics, and job roles.  

# Objective of dashboard 

(a) Identify High-Risk Groups: 

Analyse attrition rates across various departments, demographics, 
and job titles. This can help pinpoint areas with higher turnover, 
allowing HR to focus resources on retaining employees in those 
groups. 

(b) Improve Recruiting Strategies:  

By understanding which departments or demographics experience 
higher attrition, HR can adjust recruiting efforts to target specific 
skill sets or demographics needed to fill those positions. 

(c) Support Data-Driven Decision Making:  

The dashboard should provide clear and easy-to-understand data 
visualizations that can be used by HR leaders and executives to 
make informed decisions about talent management strategies.
